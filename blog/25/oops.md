# Is OOP _(that)_ bad ?

> TLDR: It's mostly used in the wrong context. OOP is not well-suited for transactional software, which are most back-end services. OOP has it's place (and origin) in simulation and graphics.

## Why is it so popular

because it is so popular. it reached critical mass and now places that have it, want it.

we know better today, a lot of languages are leaning towards fp, or claim to be 'multiple paradigm'

but what made it popular? Oracle? timing during internet boom?

## What it was

smalltalk, erlang-like agents

## What is it (common defenition)

4 pillars (aka 3 pillars)

## What it is as opposed to FP ?

marries state & behavior

## What so bad about that?

complects state & time

## Ok so whats _good_ about OOP ?

puppeteer, stateful

leads to many **emerging** patterns wrongly interpreted as recommended patterns.

GoF was about observation, to classify, not to recommend.

Design patterns, a common language, the same in multiple languages 

 --> link & write OOP design patterns vs FP design patterns, small monad explainer & how monad is like OOP(state+time) but instead (state+context/behavior).

## Is fp better ?
Typically but not always, exceptions being:
100% purity
over-abstraction

## fp sometimes equally unfit as OOPs
size/efficiency - won't fit on a pacemaker, guided payload, etc
performance - strides has been made eg immutable datastructures etc, but will never out perform c/zig. 
  you don't usually need performace if a human is in the loop, but for trading / firmware, even milliseconds can matter drastically .

## Conclusion

Really depending on the context, it can be fine.
OOPs is typically more boilerplatey than fp because of all the patterns and layers of abstraction.

? Most business computing is linear (data in -> process -> data out). FP is more apt: Stateless microservices with stateful DBs.

OOP is not well-suited for most back-end services. These are programs with the primary purpose to take inputs, process them, sometimes saving the results, and returning outputs (transactional software). Maintaining state in both memory and external storage complicates things where the actual source of truth resides in a database rather than in volatile memory (shopping carts, bank account balances, etc.. ). The fundamental principle of encapsulation that defines the O of OOP can make both composition and testing more challenging, often necessitating the use of mocking to test components in isolation.

? Where _does_ OOP fit in well ?
? OOP fits in well with stateful context like a in-memory-db, or simulation (ie games) ?
