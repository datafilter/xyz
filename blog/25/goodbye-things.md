# Book review : Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki

TLDR: Great book, would buy a third time if I needed to.

The structure of the book is a very light read. You could read a few pages, put the book down for months, and pick it up later and just continue reading.

The book starts with understanding the psychology behind why we feel compelled to collect and keep things. It makes you reconsider the way you view the things you own.

Then it goes into many practical tips to help part with stuff, often with a cheerful anecdote.

Finally, the author shares the many aspects of how his life became better as a result of getting rid of things.

# Key take-aways

1. Owning stuff is a distraction. We have to maintain, clean, manage, stow, move around, and subsequently continuously think of all the junk collected over the years.
2. We grossly over-value things we own. The actual value of stuff is the sell-price on the free market, which is _way_ lower than what we paid.
3. If something is not providing you value every year or two, it's doing the opposite.

# 2 Things that stood out to me

## Tools vs Treasure

For cavemen, it made sense to collect stuff, especially food. It meant not dying. Food was treasure.
Even though stuff is so abundant today, especially food, our brains are still wired to collect stuff.

Collecting something as a hobby like stamps or cups or whatever is fine, but collecting random junk just because we don't want to discard things just weighs us down.

What is useful to us, are tools. A thing to keep you warm, a thing to clean with, eat with, cut, smash, write, etc. They continuously provide value.

I think our brains are the same with knowledge (or just any content/media for that matter), and knowledge really isn't that useful to us in the same way.
100 years ago, having a good general knowledge meant better understanding and navigation of the world. It made the phrase "knowledge is power".
But today, I don't think so. You can look up anything, or ask a bot to give you a rough idea in a couple of seconds.
Understanding the inner workings of the sun, the Bose–Einstein condensate, or world history in 1750, is just gorging on useless knowledge if you don't apply it.
It's still very useful for humankind as a whole to know everything, just not for an individual (it's impossible btw).

Instead of learning new things, besides the entertainment of it, whether it be quantum physics or why what movie star did what this week, it would be more useful to collect mental tools.
What are common logic fallacies, how do you improve critical thinking, how do you communicate more effectively, etc.

Today, food isn't treasure, it's common. Knowledge isn't treasure. Tools are treasure - knowing how to effectively find out something quickly is worth more than knowing a lot of stuff.

## Minimizing is not organizing

Moving things around doesn't reduce complexity.
Complex: Group things together
Complicate: Things folded together. If you move one thing, one or more other things move with it.
