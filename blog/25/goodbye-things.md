# Book review : _Goodbye, Things_ - Fumio Sasaki

> TLDR: Great book, I would it buy a third time if I needed to. 
This book offers a refreshing perspective on minimalism and is structured for a very light read.
You can dive into a few pages, set it down for months, and effortlessly pick it back up later.

The book begins by exploring the psychology behind why we feel compelled to collect and keep things. It makes you reconsider the way you view the things you own.

Then it goes into many practical tips to get rid of things, often with cheerful anecdotes.

Finally, the author shares the many aspects of how his life improved after embracing minimalism.

# Key Takeaways

1. Owning stuff is a distraction; we routinely maintain, clean, store, and move around all the junk we've collected over the years.
2. We grossly over-value our possessions . The actual market value of our belongings is _way_ lower than what we paid for them.
3. If something is not providing you value every year or two, it's doing the opposite.

# Personal Reflections

## Curiosity killed the cat

For cavemen, collecting stuff, especially food, was essential for survival. It meant not dying. Food was treasure.

Although stuff is so abundant today, our brains are still wired to accumulate. While collecting hobbies like stamps or cups can be fun, hoarding random items due to overvalued attachments mostly weighs us down.
What we truly need, are tools that continuously provide value. A thing to keep you warm, something to clean with, eat with, cut, smash, appreciate, etc.

Similarly, in the realm of knowledge, we hoard. Whether it's facts about quantum physics or celebrity gossip, consuming information isn't useful to us in the same way.

A century ago, having a good general knowledge meant better understanding and navigation of the world, leading to the phrase "knowledge is power." 

Via the internet and creative chatbots, you can find or have something imagined for you in a manner of seconds.

In this day and age, one might argue that time is better spent being bored than learning without purpose.

What is useful for intellectual growth are mental tools, such as new perspectives, identifying logical fallacies, improving critical thinking, effective communication, etc.. Rather than collecting information, time is also better spent by practicing problem-solving and engaging in creative activities.

## Organizing is not minimizing

Moving things around doesn’t reduce complexity; it merely shifts it.

I found this especially relevant in software. A big chunk of relevant code on a single page is often easier to grasp than multiple layers of abstraction scattered across numerous files.

and [Simple made easy](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md)


## Conclusion

Tools are the new treasures. Knowing how to effectively find and utilize information quickly is worth more than simply knowing a lot of stuff.

Read the book. It's liberating to let go of old junk, and you might be surprised by how much more time you have on your hands.
