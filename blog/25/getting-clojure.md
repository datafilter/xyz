# Book Review: _Getting Clojure_ by Russ Olsen

>TLDR: A casual introduction to Clojure, perfectly suited for the intended audience - programmers with prior experience. The tone of the book is very conversational, making it both fun and light to read.

## Structure

The book follows a well-structured approach in each chapter, namely:
- Describing features and concepts
- Exploring examples in real-world code
- Highlighting common pitfalls to avoid

The academic structure, i.e., introduction and wrap-up, used in each chapter might feel a bit wordy at first, but I’ve found that it really helps make it easier to absorb the information.

## Not 5 Stars, but Close!

You might come across an odd forced example, a quirky fictional reference, or the occasional imprecise or inconsistent term here and there, but that doesn't detract from the book in any significant way.

Rather than comparing it to a technical specification, consider the book a friendly conversation to get you started on your journey. As the author puts it—paraphrasing—it's up to you to learn Clojure with a keyboard and some patience; he's just here to show you the ropes.

## Understanding Clojure from the Inside Out

Rather than comparing Clojure to other languages, it immerses you in idiomatic Clojure right from the start.

The author refrains from reiterating beginner concepts yet doesn't skim over any parts related to understanding the language, the underlying principles, and how it might be implemented.

After an engaging journey through Clojure, you're led to the exciting realization that you might just be able to write your own Lisp. By the end, the conclusion reveals how Clojure's homoiconicity makes implementing a REPL surprisingly straightforward. Ha! I was pleasantly surprised a couple of times like this throughout the book.

## Conclusion

I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in exploring Clojure or gaining a fresh perspective on problem-solving.
