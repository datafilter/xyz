# Book Review: _Getting Clojure_ by Russ Olsen

> **TL;DR**: A casual yet insightful introduction to Clojure, perfectly suited for experienced programmers. The book’s conversational tone makes it both engaging and enjoyable to read.

## Structure

Each chapter follows a well-organized approach:
- Introduction 
- Getting into key features and concepts
- Exploring real-world examples
- Highlighting common pitfalls to avoid
- Wrap-up

The introduction and wrap-up in each chapter help reinforce comprehension, making it easier to absorb the material. The real-world examples and common pitfalls to watch out for makes the material tangible and practical.

## Understanding Clojure from the Inside Out

Rather than comparing Clojure to other languages, the book fully immerses you in idiomatic Clojure right from the start.

The author avoids unnecessary repetition of beginner concepts yet ensures a thorough explanation of the language’s core principles and potential implementations.

Through this engaging journey, you arrive at the realization that you might just be able to write your own Lisp. The conclusion ties everything together by demonstrating how Clojure’s homoiconicity makes implementing a REPL surprisingly straightforward. Wow :D I was pleasantly surprised multiple times throughout the book with the ideas of Clojure, and the author did a great job to bring lots of those elementst to light that you might not otherwise find by just doing exercises or tutorials.

## Conclusion

If I had to nitpick, you _might_ notice occasional inconsistencies or a few forced examples, but these minor issues don't detract from the book in any meaningful way.

This isn’t a technical specification—but that’s precisely what makes it so enjoyable. It feels more like a friendly conversation designed to kickstart your journey. As the author puts it - paraphrasing - it's up to you to learn Clojure with a keyboard and some patience; he's just here to show you the ropes.

Overall, *Getting Clojure* is an excellent introduction to the language, providing a solid foundation for further learning and exploration. If you're interested in Clojure or unfamiliar with LISP dialects, I highly recommend it—its insights are well worth it.
